## Introduction

This is the workshop website for the Shiny for Python Workshop at [Shiny in Production](https://shiny-in-production.jumpingrivers.com/).

While most of these materials are designed to be used in conjunction with the workshop, they also stand alone as an educational resource.


## Background

This workshop is aimed at people who are somewhat familiar with doing data analysis in Python, but do not have much of a background in Shiny. 

If you are brand new to Python we recommend spending a bit of time familiarizing yourself with the following topics before the workshop: 

- How to install Python packages in a virtual environment 
- How to do basic data manipulation with `pandas` or `polars`
- How to draw plots 
- How to clone a repository with git
